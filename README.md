Split long GPX route because Polar Vantage V is limited to [500 waypoints](https://support.polar.com/sg-en/how-to-import-route):

> If the route is long, it will be compressed into 500 waypoints when it is transferred to Grit X/Grit X Pro/Pacer Pro/V650/Vantage/Vantage V2

This is especially useful when you are running ultras.
